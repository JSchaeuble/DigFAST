# DigFAST
Digital Facsimile Authoring Support Tool (Based on TEI P5)

This tool is designed to support the encoding of "Digital Facsimiles" in TEI. For the time being it's a prototype that supports only a small subset of the possible TEI elements and attributes for diplomatic document encoding. Especially on the phrase level (e.g. tei:add and tei:del elements) the tool is not yet elaborated.

DigFAST is not capable of encoding rich TEI documents, but it can be used to capture the basic structure and spacial dimensions of a source document (and the zones and lines within) and to refer them to authorial text stages (tei:change). DigFast does not aim to be a full TEI/XML Editor but to visually support the first steps in the creation of a digital facsimile. The resulting TEI document can be exported and edited with an XML editor of your choice.

Planning and implementation: J. Sch√§uble, University of Passau, Germany
as part of the project "Diachronic Markup and Presentation Practices for Text Edition in Digital Research Environments", funded by NEH and DFG
